![La música de los números primos by Marcus du Sautoy][1]
{: .side-image }

After the complex and fascinating reading of *What We Cannot Know* by Marcus du
Sautoy, I read *The Music of the Primes* (*La música de los números primos*).

On this occasion, he makes a tour on the history and mathematical research of
the prime numbers. These are some of the stories covered in the book:
- Euclid. Demonstration of infinite prime numbers.
- University of Göttingen.
- Gauss. Instead of predicting what the prime numbers will be, he wondered how
  many prime numbers there are. Notice a pattern – as numbers increase, the
  number of prime numbers decrease.
- Riemann hypothesis. Using the zeta function he constructs a mathematical
  landscape where he connects the distribution of prime numbers with geometry.
  Are all zeros on the same line?
- University of Cambridge.
- Hardy. Demonstration of infinite zeros on the line.
- Ramanujan. Formula for calculating prime numbers with a tiny margin of error.
- Turing. Build a machine to demonstrate that Riemann's hypothesis is false.
- Computer. All calculations show that as far as we have counted all zeros are
  on the line.
- Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies.
- Montgomery - Dyson. Behaviour of atoms corresponds to the behaviour of prime
  numbers.
- RSA. Factorization of prime numbers.
