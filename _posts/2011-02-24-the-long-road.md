I believe that continuous learning is a core skill everyone should have.

A few days ago I finished to read an amazing book: [Apprenticeship Patterns][1]{:target="_blank"}.

The book is a catalog of patterns that allow us to improve as developers and it's
very focus in the software craftsmanship philosophy.

![Software Craftsmanship][2]

The patterns are divided into different sections:

1. Introduction. The introduction explains what software craftsmanship.

2. Emptying the Cup. It starts with a little story of a Zen master, keep an open mind and face our ignorance.

3. Walking the Long Road. Think long term, decide the way you want to go and stay motivated.

4. Accurate Self-Assessment. Be the worst of a team, interacting with other developers, find mentors.

5. Perpetual Learning. Very specific tips to constantly learn and stay current.

6. Construct Your Curriculum. You have to read continuously and become expert.
