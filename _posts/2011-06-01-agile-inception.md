Many projects die before release it, mainly for two reasons:

- They fail to ask the right questions.
- They don't have the courage to ask the difficult questions.

When a project begins, each team member an idea of it and how to do so
successfully. But this view may be completely different to the rest.

The Agile by Samurai Jonathan Rasmusson describes the [Agile Project Inception][1]{:target="_blank"}.

Basically what is proposed is to consider a series of questions before
starting any project. The idea behind this is to bring the project to its
true essence, defining and communicating that vision between all team members.

### 10 Questions

#### 1. Why are we here?

This is the first and most obvious question. It is a reminder of why we are
here, who are our customers, and why we decided to do this project.

#### 2. Create an elevator pitch

If we had thirty seconds and two sentences to describe our project, what
would we say?

#### 3. Design a product box

If we flip through a magazine and see an advertisement of our product or
service, what would it say? and most important, would you like to buy it?

#### 4. Create a NOT List

We have a clear idea about what we are going to do in this project.
Let's try to be more clear and see what we will not do.

#### 5. Know your community

The community of our project is always bigger than we think.

#### 6. Show the solution

Think in a high-level the architecture and technologies that we are going to use.

#### 7. Ask what keeps us up at night

There are a thousand things that could wrong on our projects. Some we can handle.
Others we canâ€™t. This exercise is about making sure we identify the risks.

#### 8. Size it up

Is it a three, six or nine months project?

#### 9. What are your priorities?

All projects have levers like time, money, scope, and quality. What is the most
and least important to this project at this time?

#### 10. How much is it?

How much is it? What team are we going to need?
