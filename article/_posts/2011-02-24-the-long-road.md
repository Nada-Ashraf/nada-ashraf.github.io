I believe that continuous learning is a core skill everyone should have.

A few days ago I finished reading an amazing book: [Apprenticeship Patterns][1]{:target="_blank"}.

_Apprenticeships Patterns_ features a catalog of patterns that allow us to improve as developers and
focuses on the software craftsmanship philosophy.

![Software Craftsmanship][2]

The patterns are divided into different sections:

1. Introduction: explains what software craftsmanship is.

2. Emptying the cup: starts with a little story of a Zen master, keep an open mind and face our ignorance.

3. Walking the long road: centers on thinking long term, deciding which way you want to go and staying motivated.

4. Accurate self-assessment: looks at how being the worst in a team can be a
   good thing, interacting with other developers and finding mentors.

5. Perpetual learning: gives very specific tips on constantly learning and staying updated.

6. Construct your curriculum: discusses why you have to read continuously and become expert.
