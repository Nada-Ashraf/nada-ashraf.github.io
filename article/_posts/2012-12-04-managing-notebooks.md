There are a lot of tools to organize and get work done, some are more focused
on task management like [Wunderlist][1]{:target="_blank"} and others are more focused on
project management like [Trello][2]{:target="_blank"}.

These are great tools, but I prefer notebooks over other devices and media. It's the same feelings with
books and e-readers. I love the feel of paper and provide a better user
experience for me.

In many ways it's more versatile than software because I can
organize my daily tasks, communicate ideas through drawing, sketchnotes, create
lists, project planning, journal, quotes, random thoughts...
