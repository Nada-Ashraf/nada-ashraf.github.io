## Software Development & Stuff

I'm a software engineer. I'm living in London, United Kingdom. I work at [Coinfloor][1]{:target="_blank"}.

I seek excellence in everything I do. I share my passion for programming, ideas
and practices, attention to detail, and self improvement. I treat programming
like a craft, code cleanly and want to get better at it each day. Crafting a
great product or service starts with a deep understanding of the business and
the context around it.

I'm constantly looking for better ways to develop software. I believe that
continuous learning is a core skill everyone should have. I love developing
software but I can't just be programmer anymore, to improve my craft, I need to
understand the whole.

I explore new ideas rather than follow the established assumptions. I believe
that every goal is achievable.

### Personal projects

I love open source and I'm continually learning and working in personal projects.
