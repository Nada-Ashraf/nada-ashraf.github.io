## Software Development & Stuff

I am a software engineer living in London, United Kingdom. I work at [AMEE][9]{:target="_blank"}.

I seek excellence in everything I do. I share my passion for programming, ideas
and practices, attention to detail, and self improvement with those around me.
I treat programming like a craft, code cleanly, and continue to better myself
all the time. Crafting a great product or service starts with a deep
understanding of the business and the context around it.

I am constantly looking for better ways to develop software. I believe that
continuous learning is a core skill everyone should have. I love developing
software but I can not just be a programmer anymore. I am currently working on
expanding my skill set to include product and user experiences, design, and
other areas. To improve my craft, I need to understand the whole.


### Personal projects

I love open source and I'm continually learning and working in personal projects.
Check out my [GitHub account][2]{:target="_blank"} to see what I have been hacking on lately.

- [iShows][8] is an iPhone app to managing TV shows.
