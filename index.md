Hello! I'm Arturo. I write code and I live in London.

## Software Development

Software is my craft.

I've written a lot of code in Ruby and Groovy, and I'm working to deepen my
knowledge in functional languages.

As a software engineer I seek excellence in everything I do. I share my passion
for programming, ideas and practices, attention to detail, and self improvement
with those around me.


## Projects

I love open source and I'm continually learning and working in personal projects.
Check out my [GitHub account][2]{:target="_blank"} to see what I've been hacking on lately.

- [iShows][8] is an iPhone app to managing TV shows.
- [Project 365][9]{:target="_blank"} one picture a day, for a whole year.
