Hello! I'm Arturo. I write code and I live in London.

## Software Development

Software is my craft.

I've written a lot of code in Ruby and Groovy, and I'm working on deepening my
knowledge in functional languages.

I strive for excellence and share my passion for programming, ideas and
practices with those around me.


## Projects

I love open source and I'm continually learning and working on personal projects.
Check out my [GitHub account][2]{:target="_blank"} to see what I've been hacking on lately.

- [iShows][8] is an iPhone app designed to track TV shows.


## Articles

I publish articles from time to time, which you will find on the [articles archive][3].


## Life Streaming

I'm [@ArturoHerrero][4]{:target="_blank"} on Twitter.


## Reading

Reading is one of my passions, and I keep a [list of the books I read][7].


## Writing

I wrote a book about Markdown, published by Packt Publishing: *[Instant Markdown][5]{:target="_blank"}*.


## Presenting

Occasionally, I speak at conferences. You will find more information on my [talks page][6].
